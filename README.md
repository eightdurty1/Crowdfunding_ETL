Crowdfunding ETL Mini Project
Project Overview
This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to transform crowdfunding data for storage in a PostgreSQL database. Working with a partner, we extracted and cleaned data using Python and Pandas, generated categorized CSV files, and created a PostgreSQL database to store the structured data. The end goal is a streamlined, reliable database to support crowdfunding campaign analysis.

Tools and Technologies
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Regular Expressions
Database: PostgreSQL
Other Tools: GitHub for version control, Jupyter Notebook for development
